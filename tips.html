          <h3 class="tips">Invest In A Planer</h3>
            <p class="description">Investing in a planner can help in the long run to keep track a set schedule. Knowing how to use a planner is essential beforehand because you can have a planner and not use it at all. In order to use a planner you must make it a habit to write important dates or assignments. After, writing any important reminders for the day, you must remember to look back at it, because the purpose is to have a written plan to look back on. Additionally, the counseling center provides free small planners.</p>
          <h3 class="tips">Make A To-Do List</h3>
            <p class="description">Another way to manage your activities and assignments that you must complete is to make a to-do list. A to-do list is similar to a planner, but is a checklist. To use a to-do list to its max effectiveness, you should list the activities/ assignments that are most important at the top.</p>
          <h3 class="tips">90 minutes on - 30 miuntes off</h3>
            <p class="description">The rule of thumb when working intensely on an assignment is to work for 90 minutes. After the 90 minutes, take a 15-30 minute break in order to give your brain a break.</p>

          <h4 class="locations">> Eating Smart</h4>
            <p>
            Food diaries are helpful to track information of every meal you intake. During stressful times, many fall back on stress eating as a way to cope. Meanwhile,
            others may not at all. However, both are not healthy eating habits. <br> Through the food diary a person can pick up on patterns when they ate the most and how they were feeling during that time. For someone that is stressed it can help trigger the root of your stress eating. Helping them make different choices when they are feeling stressed about the trigger that they had previously experienced. Additionally, the owner of the diary can track if they have been eating enough or more than usual.

            <h4 class="locations">> Using Bed Time Setting</h4>
              <p class="description">
              Many devices are implementing a bed time setting. Apple is one company that has implemented it in their devices as a setting for user. The bed time setting allows users to set a wake up time and a bed time. Through this setting the user can now have an alert 15 minutes before the intended bed time. <br> While people are stressed they forget that sleep is very essential, people tend to get wrapped up in their work and don't realize that everyone needs more than 3 hours of sleep. Therefore, using the bed time setting can remind a person to get some sleep.
              </p>
            <h4 class="locations">> Implement App Limit</h4>
              <p class="description">
              Similar to the bed time setting, devices also have app limit setting. Through this setting the user can limit what times they can access specific apps and how long they can use those apps on a daily basis. Many people will procrastinate or sleep late because they are on their phone, which leads them to being stress and not having enough sleep. Therefore, this ties in with managing your time so that you aren't stressed because of procrastinating and external distractions.
              </p>
            <h4 class="locations">> ASMR</h4>
              <p class="description">
              When people are stressed they tend to have a difficult time falling asleep. A common trend online is the use of ASMR, Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. ASMR is the use of noises to stimulate the body to feel a sense of tingling and calmness. Many have reported that they listen to ASMR before bed to help them unwind and fall sleep.
